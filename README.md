A data analysis project using NASA NEO data from 2018

Notice that there is large number of asteroids that seem to be less than 0 kilometers? Peculiar.

For the most part, this data set doesn't present many valuable correlations which can be applied to an x y plot.
I have a hunch there are other, non-traditional, visualizations I can use to uncover hidden patterns...
